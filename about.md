![Aaron Ralls][me]

Thank you for visiting my site!

My name is Aaron Ralls, a cloud architect with 20 years of experience.  I have a depth of experience with Microsoft tools and technologies. I will focus on covering solutions for business process and emerging technologies.

Right-sized solutions ™ is a concept of focusing on resolving the business issue vs. the symptoms. Simple and affordable solutions are the goal.

I have a couple of beliefs that have helped me in my career. First, there is nothing that we can't accomplish when we apply our positive energy. Second, I love teaching others what I have learned along the way to help them succeed. 

The quote I came across that best embodies my main driver in life is:
> *Success comes in cans, not cant's* ~ Joel Weldon
